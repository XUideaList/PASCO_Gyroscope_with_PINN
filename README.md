# PASCO_Gyroscope_with_PINN
From the data obtained during the experiment originally from PASCO's gyroscope experiment, I have used classification(supervised learning) and PINN for trajectory prediction. For detail, please refer to the README file

# Solving the DE derived using Conservation of Angular Momentum
Note that the motion of equation implemented in this file uses Euler's method, which eventually occurs a significant amount of error.
Hence there is space for improvement using other methods when solving the given differential equation. (For example, Runge Futta 4'th method)
ã„´ Actually this might be the reason of the differnece between our numerical plot and the experimental data. (I'll leave it out untill I get some time)
